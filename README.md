# SOUTH_AFRICA_CRIME_INTELLIGENCE_PROJECT
This project explores a simulated South African criminal case dataset using SQL to answer 30 real-world investigative and analytical questions. The analysis focuses on crime patterns, fraud cases, suspect profiles, financial risk indicators, and law enforcement outcomes across provinces.

🇿🇦 South Africa Criminal Database — SQL Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview

This project analyses a simulated South African criminal case dataset using SQL to answer 30 investigative and business-style questions. The dataset represents criminal records across provinces and includes information about crime types, suspects, financial fraud amounts, risk levels, arrests, and case outcomes.

The objective of this project was to develop practical SQL skills while extracting meaningful insights that could support law enforcement, risk management, and policy decision-making.

🎯 Project Objectives

Using SQL queries, this project aims to:

* Explore criminal case data across South Africa

* Identify crime patterns by province and year

* Analyse fraud-related financial impact

* Examine suspect demographics and risk levels

* Measure law enforcement outcomes (arrests, convictions)

* Translate real-world investigative questions into SQL

🧠 Key Analytical Areas

The project investigates questions such as:

🔎 How many criminal cases exist overall and per province?
💰 What is the total and average estimated fraud amount?
📊 Which crime types are most common?
🚨 Which cases are classified as high or critical risk?
👮 How many suspects were arrested or convicted?
📈 How have cases changed over time?
🏦 Which banks are most associated with fraud cases?
👤 What are the age patterns of suspects?

🛠️ SQL Concepts Used

This project demonstrates practical use of core SQL techniques:

SELECT — Data retrieval

WHERE — Filtering records

ORDER BY — Sorting results

COUNT() — Measuring case volumes

SUM() — Calculating total fraud amounts

AVG() — Analysing averages

MAX() / MIN() — Identifying extremes

GROUP BY — Aggregating data by categories

TOP — Extracting highest-priority records
